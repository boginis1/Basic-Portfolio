		<h2>About Me </h2>
		<img id="Holly" src="assets/images/Holly 100.jpg" alt="Holly Zoba"> 

 		<p> I spent my first 15 years running hotels and my last ten years selling training to hotels.  My area of expertise has always been in the sales and marketing arena for hospitality.  I have recognized so many technology opportunities for the hospitality industry and so I recently decided to learn a lot more about what might be possible.  My goal is to develop some applications that will enable hotel owners and operators to increase their revenues and reduce their expenses by putting better tools in the hands of their sales and marketing teams. </p>
 		<br>
 		<p> I have spent the last two years as the chair of the digital marekting council for HSMAI which has given me the opportunity to hear from the digital heads representing the big brands, the larger management companies, individual resorts,  hotel website developers and other tech vendors to the hospitality space.  This unqiue perspective has made me aware of  what is missing in world of digital for hotels and I hope to be able to contribute to filling those voids. </p>
